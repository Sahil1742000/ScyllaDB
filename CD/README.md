## Introduction

This document outlines a Proof of Concept (POC) for setting up **Continuous Deployment (CD)** for a Terraform module. The goal of this POC is to automate the deployment process of infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring that every change to the infrastructure code automatically gets applied and deployed to the environment.

In this document, we will implement a CI/CD pipeline using popular tools like **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**, integrate with **Terraform**, and focus on ensuring seamless, automated infrastructure deployments.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure the following:

- Terraform (v0.12 or later)
- A CI/CD tool such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI
- Access to a version control system (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- Cloud provider credentials (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Basic understanding of Terraform, Cloud Infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines

## Directory Structure

The directory structure for the Terraform module with CD pipeline will look like this:

```
terraform-cd-poc/
├── .github/
│   └── workflows/
│       └── terraform-cd.yml        # GitHub Actions Workflow file
├── modules/
│   └── ec2-instance/
│       ├── main.tf                 # EC2 Instance Terraform module
│       ├── variables.tf            # Variables for EC2 module
│       ├── outputs.tf              # Outputs of EC2 module
│       └── terraform.tfvars        # Example variable values
├── environment/
│   ├── dev/
│   │   └── terraform.tfvars        # Environment-specific variables for dev
│   └── prod/
│       └── terraform.tfvars        # Environment-specific variables for prod
└── README.md                       # This documentation file
```

- **`modules/`**: Contains the reusable Terraform modules (e.g., EC2 instance).
- **`environment/`**: Holds environment-specific variables for different environments like `dev` or `prod`.
- **`.github/`**: Contains the CI/CD configuration for GitHub Actions (or another CI tool if you prefer).
- **`README.md`**: This document providing the overview of the POC.

## CD Pipeline Setup

This section walks you through setting up a **Continuous Deployment (CD)** pipeline for your Terraform module. The idea is to automate the deployment process so that every time changes are pushed to the repository, the code is deployed automatically to the relevant environment.

### 4.1 GitHub Actions Example

In GitHub Actions, we define the CD pipeline in the `terraform-cd.yml` workflow file, located inside `.github/workflows/`.

```yaml
name: Terraform CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  terraform:
    name: 'Terraform Plan and Apply'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
        with:
          terraform_version: 1.5.0

      - name: Terraform Init
        run: terraform init

      - name: Terraform Validate
        run: terraform validate

      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: terraform plan -out=tfplan

      - name: Terraform Apply
        run: terraform apply -auto-approve tfplan

      - name: Terraform Destroy
        run: terraform destroy -auto-approve
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

**Explanation:**

- **Triggering**: This pipeline triggers on a push or pull request to the `main` branch.
- **Terraform Setup**: Uses the `setup-terraform` GitHub Action to install the necessary version of Terraform.
- **Terraform Init**: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- **Terraform Validate**: Validates the Terraform code.
- **Terraform Plan and Apply**: Executes `terraform plan` to show the changes and `terraform apply` to apply those changes automatically.
- **Terraform Destroy**: If the event is a pull request to the main branch, it runs `terraform destroy` to remove infrastructure resources.

### 4.2 Jenkins Example

In Jenkins, you can configure a similar pipeline with a `Jenkinsfile` that automates the deployment process.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        TF_VAR_region = 'us-east-1'
    }
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                checkout scm
            }
        }
        stage('Terraform Init') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'terraform init'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Terraform Plan') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'terraform plan'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Terraform Apply') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
                }
            }
        }
    }
    post {
        always {
            echo 'Terraform process completed.'
        }
        success {
            echo 'Terraform apply completed successfully.'
        }
        failure {
            echo 'Terraform apply failed.'
        }
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Checkout**: Pulls the latest code from the repository.
- **Terraform Init**: Initializes the Terraform working directory.
- **Terraform Plan**: Generates the execution plan for Terraform.
- **Terraform Apply**: Applies the changes to the cloud provider.
- **Post Actions**: Ensures logging after the process is complete, regardless of success or failure.

## Terraform Configuration

### 5.1 Variables

You define the input variables in the `variables.tf` file, which the Terraform module will use. Example:

```hcl
variable "instance_type" {
  description = "Type of EC2 instance"
  type        = string
  default     = "t2.micro"
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "AMI ID for the EC2 instance"
  type        = string
}
```

### 5.2 Resources

In `main.tf`, define the resources that will be deployed by Terraform. For example, an EC2 instance resource:

```hcl
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = var.ami_id
  instance_type = var.instance_type

  tags = {
    Name = "ExampleInstance"
  }
}
```

## Deployment Strategy

In this POC, we are using a **blue/green deployment strategy** for continuous deployment:

- **Blue Environment**: The live environment that is being used.
- **Green Environment**: The new version of the infrastructure is deployed here.
  
When a new commit is pushed, the new version is deployed to the **Green Environment**. Once it's validated, the traffic is switched to the green environment.

You can manage this deployment using features such as **AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** or **Azure Traffic Manager** for rolling out changes with minimal downtime.

## Terraform State Management

Using a **remote backend** is crucial for collaborative infrastructure management. To store the Terraform state remotely and ensure that multiple users or pipelines can access it, configure the S3 backend with DynamoDB for state locking in the `main.tf` file.

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    dynamodb_table = "my-terraform-lock"
    encrypt        = true
  }
}
```

This backend setup ensures that the Terraform state is stored securely and centrally, with state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

## Testing and Validation

### Local Testing

You can test the module locally before deploying it in the pipeline:

1. Initialize the Terraform directory: `terraform init`
2. Validate the configuration: `terraform validate`
3. Generate a plan to preview changes: `terraform plan`
4. Apply the changes to the cloud provider: `terraform apply`

### CI/CD Testing

Once the CI/CD pipeline is set up, pushing changes to the repository will automatically trigger the deployment process, including testing and validation steps. Monitor the pipeline to ensure that the Terraform code is applied successfully.
