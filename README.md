ScyllaDB is a type of  database that's designed to store and manage large amounts of data across many computers in a way that's fast and scalable.

In simple terms:

NoSQL means it's not based on traditional tables like in relational databases (like MySQL or PostgreSQL). Instead, it's designed for handling data that doesn't fit neatly into rows and columns.
Scalable means it can grow as your data growsâ€”whether you have a small amount of data or petabytes of data, ScyllaDB can handle it.
Fast: It's optimized for performance, meaning it can handle many requests quickly, even when there are millions of users or huge amounts of data.
